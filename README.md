- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @daisy-r-s
- I'm currently doing my PhD in Chemical Biology in London. I frequently use Python scripting for my data analysis and am always learning. I'd class myself as a Python novice! 
- I'm interested in any Python scripts people have written/have underway for patch-clamp, single molecule and other fluorescence analyses.
- I'm also interested in writing Python scripts for specialist chemical biology/biophysics analyses like this myself, but I am still learning.
